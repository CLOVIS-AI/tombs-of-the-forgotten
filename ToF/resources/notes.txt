1   She's talkative, energetic, calm and perhaps a little too arrogant. But there's more than meets the eye, not surprising for somebody with her position. She was born in a royal family in a large port. She lived free of trouble until she was about 15 years old, but at that point life changed. She went to college and was learning a lot of new skills. With amazing, new friends, she is trying to help others in a crazy world. But with her determination and bravery, there's nothing to stop her from staying ahead of the game. She could quickly become somebody we can expect great things of. But anything could happen; she is currently still looking for a true calling. She feels like there's more to learn in this world. Luckily she has amazing friends to support her. I will always be there for her. -B
2   Put your everything in even the smallest step and you'll be on the path to success. Put your heart, mind, and soul into even your smallest acts. This is the secret of success. 
3   Please help! My mom is in danger out there. I'm stuck here and don't know how much time is left. I pray the gods to spare us and my family. Weird stuff are going on outside. I'm scared. I don't want to die. Yesterday everything was fine. What now?!
4   Here I lie and here I die. Hope you'll find me and understand what's wrong here. Choose the right path or they'll catch you.
5   Say my name and I disappear. What am I? The answer is: Silence.
6   I use to play with my two little sisters the riddle game. I miss them. I don't know what happened to them, but I'm sure they aren't safe. What went wrong suddenly? Why do I hear bloodfreezing screams. We aren't safe here. Even if they tell us we are. Something terrible is happening. Something that will deceive all of us. Soon or later, it will be my turn. Lucy, Conny, I love you.
7   Almighty God, custodian of life, I beg you to hear my prayer. Grant me strength so I might go forth in your name. I request this of you on both my knees, o all-powerful god. Absolve me with your gracious favor.
8   Dearest God, eternal light in the darkness, I beg you to hear my prayer. Illuminate me with your light so I might overcome my grief. I plead this of you in your hallowed name, o eternal holiness. Favor me with your heavenly soul.
9   Heavenly Mother, infinite light of the world, your humble servant calls to you. Sustain me with your power so I might be filled with joy. I seek this of you as your faithful child, o giver of life. Bless me with your divine favor.
10   Sacred Mother, glory be to you, I strayed from the path and stepped into darkness. Forgive me, I neglected to congregate with the saints. Wipe away my sins, have mercy on my soul. Allow me to repent so I may be rid of this guilt and live life afresh.
11   Zihetism is an age-old religion with several main gods and a dozen or so minor gods. Their main teachings revolve around heaven and virtues, and these teachings are often passed on through communal praying sessions and readings by spiritual leaders. Zihetism's teachings come from a translated book supposedly given by a few demi-gods who came down to Earth at the beginning of time. The majority of their religious symbols are represented in the form of buildings, skin paintings and wood carvings. Despite being an age-old religion, Zihetism has remained a single religion with different variations of it, . Zihetism is usually met with indifference by people around the rest of the world.
12   You shall offer your service to those in need. You shall be united or seek unity if there is none. You shall strife for excellence. You shall love your country. You shall not use or think of people as property. You shall not break promises. You shall seek out diversity in all aspects of life. You shall not take any life. You shall never harm a child. You shall be considerate of others well being.
13   Good life, good death. Eternal and just. Eternal shepherds. Ever the same, ever the different. Power, progress, peace. Truth sets us free. Pride and honor. Weave trust with trust. Peace, justice, progress. We are and always will be.
14   Every 2 years the Festival of Nations is celebrated with eager participation. It's a holiday with spiritual roots, but today it is mostly associated with games of chance, forgiving others, decorating homes and hanging around campfires. It is officially celebrated for eight days, but the closing celebrations are what everybody looks forward to the most.
15   Every 6 months the Festival of Shadows is celebrated with big imaginations. It's a holiday with undiscovered roots, but today it is mostly associated with helping strangers, games of chance, telling jokes and playing pranks. It is officially celebrated for 2 weeks, but decorations are often found well before and after that time as well.
16   Let my son rest in peace and bless his soul. It's easy to get to know an open person like my beloved son Pierre, but the two traits most people enjoy the most are that he's protective and enthusiastic. Of course he's also tolerant, balanced and forgiving, but they're in shorter supply, especially considering they're mixed with being irresponsible as well. His protective nature though, this is what he's kind of cherished for. On many occasions people will count on this and his stable nature when they're in need of support. Nobody's perfect of course and Pierre has plenty of less favorable characteristics too. His selfishness and apathetic nature pose plenty of problems and reach all around. Fortunately his enthusiasm helps keep them in check for at least a little.
17   A lot can be assumed when you first see Kayla Parker, but if nothing else you should know she's wise and respectful. Of course she's also caring, modest and dutiful, but these are in a way balance by being agonizing as well. Her wisdom though, this is what she's pretty much loved for. People often count on this and her openness when they're feeling down. Nobody's perfect of course and Kayla has plenty of rainy days too. Her ego and venomous nature tend to get in the way and just affect all around negatively. Fortunately her respect assures this isn't the case very often.
18   Few know the true Harley Francis, but if nothing else you should know he's capable and empathetic. Of course he's also punctual, open and ambitious, but they're tainted by and mixed with habits of being treacherous as well. His capabilities though, this is what he's often adored for. Friends frequently count on this and his sense of balance when they're in need of support. Nobody's perfect of course and Harley has rotten moods and days too. His desperation and laziness can cause things to heat up and just affect all around negatively. Fortunately his empathy usually softens the worst of it.
19   WHATS IS GOING ON HERE???!!!
20   I am hungry. They are consuming us little by little. There is nothing we can do. We were meant to this destiny. That awful destiny.
21   Clara, Have you hear what Jason did? OMG it was unbelievable! I hope Lara didn't see it. Picture her face if someone tells her. What if this someone would be me? haha xx
22   We are meant to die.
23   We are meant to live.
24   What's about life?
25   Please. Help me.
26   It's been hours since my dad left the room. Something terrible happened outside. They won't tell us what. My fragile little brother and I are scared. But my mother keeps telling us that everything's fine. Why don't I believe her?

# Notes
# Every line beginning by a # is ignored
# Every empty line is ignored
# Each line should be written in the following format:
# 1 The user...
# (that is; INTEGER SPACE TEXT)

# The rules with IDs are the following:
#  - Any positive integer is allowed (only composed of digits [0..9])
#  - To allow backward-compatibility, IDs should not be removed.
# This means that, when updating this file, you CAN:
#  - Add a new ID/content pair
#  - Change the content of a particular ID
# But you CANT:
#  - Remove an ID (otherwise players who created their world on an old version
#    might not be able to load their save in the new version)
